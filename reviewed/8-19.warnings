Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 71, '1/4', 'V6') ms3.Parse.monteverdi_madrigals.8-19
	The label 'V6' in m. 71, onset 1/4 (MC 71, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.v, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#7', '2', '5') [('D#', 'F#', 'B')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
